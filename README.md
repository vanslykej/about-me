An short introduction to Jake Van Slyke and his experience with "Software Everywhere!"

My name is Jacob Van Slyke and I am a freshman at Allegheny College. I am on the track to becoming a computer science major, and am currently in a course titled "Software Everywhere." I have always been interested in software and how people are able to interact with technology to make their lives easier. I am particularly interested in the design aspect of software and I hope to get into this field someday.

I first became exposed to, and later obsessed with, the world of software and technology when Apple first started gaining notoriety for their world-changing devices. I was immediately drawn towards Steve Jobs and his company because they were creating this connection between hardware and software that had never been seen before. I still remember a line I read back then that said: "He knew what we wanted before we did," and how true that is. I have loved Apple products ever since, and continue to be interested in the evolution of software and its effect on the world.
